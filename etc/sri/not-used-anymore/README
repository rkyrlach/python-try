This directory (/etc/sri) contains information describing how
the BeagleBone will configure itself during boot.

Each pair of controllers will be assigned to a lane number.

A specific controller will either act as a Lane controller or
Car controller.

A Car controller will initiate the hostapd service and act as
an access point with its ESSID specific to a lane number and
the channel assigned similarly.

A Lane controller will initiate the wpa_supplicant service and
act as a station attempting to connect to the ESSID assigned
to that lane.

All Car controllers will use the IP 10.0.0.1
All Lane controllers will use the IP 10.0.0.2

The subnet assigned will be a /28

The host file for all controllers will have the following
entries assigned for communication between them:

10.0.0.1        car
10.0.0.2        lane

Connected to each controller will be a dipswitch device
that can be read on the SPI bus to determine whether the
controller is acting as a Car or Lane controller and what
ID the Car or Lane controller is assigned to.  This
information will be used to determine what services are
started and what configuration files are used (or generated)
for each controller.

A shell script will be executed that is responsible for
configuring the proper service and starting it with
systemd.  At boot time, no services will be started
automatically.  The script in this directory will probe
the dipswitch register and perform the proper configuration.

The two services we need to toggle between are:
   wpa_supplicant@wlan0.service
   hostapd.service


/lib/systemd/system/usbmuxd.service file has a restart command added so this file need to be
coppied for the iPad hotplug fix
